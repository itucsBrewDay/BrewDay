        Home brewing is the process of producing beer on a small scale for personal purposes. Brew Day is an application for home brewers to save and share their beer recipes and to find new ones in recipe database. Brewers can create, update and delete their recipes in this project. In this application, users can store the equipment they have along with their brewing capacities. In addition, the amount of ingredients to produce a beer can be stored and using this kind of information, the application can suggest a daily recipe among the shared ones by other users. This suggestion is determined in a way that it can be produced with the current  ingredients and equipments. This feature is called “What should I brew today”. <br/><br/> Brewers like to log their recipes, for future reference, and maintain an updated list of available ingredients, for shopping before the next brew. The database, storing components of project such as recipes, user profiles, ingredients and equipments, will be implemented for back-end development. Besides, a user interface will be provided for users to interact with the system.
